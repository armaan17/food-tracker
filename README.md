description: This is a food tracker app which allows the user to add any number of users and create a food log for each one.
Each food log consists of the user, where the food was bought, what food you ate, how much money was spent on the food, and the date the food was purchased.
Once the user enters a log, it is displayed on a food log list which contains all the logs. The list also has a delete option for each log. 
At the bottom of the list, the log consits the total cost of food on the food list.
